My name is Michael Giannella, and I am a Junior Computer Engineering student at [Rutgers University][ru] in New Brunswick, NJ. On campus, I am involved in the [Institue of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)][ieee] club as a [N2E][n2e] Python instructor, where I teach weekly classes to undergraduates looking to expand their skillset. I also play intramural basketball and flag football.

This past summer, I worked at [Prudential Global Investment Management][pgim] in the Investments Technology department. I worked on a team that was redesigning monolithic applications and processes and converting them to a microservice architecture all connected through a central portal. As an Application and Systems Development intern, I worked on a web application for calculating dividend payout dates, I administered Windows servers, and I wrote scripts to automate processes on the servers, such as vital reporting and TFS release reporting.

I'm interested in DevOps and software engineering in general. I enjoy working both on the product and the process, and working as efficiently as possible, leveraging any tools that may be useful. I have experience working with Python, Java, C, C#, and HTML/CSS. Additionally, some technologies I've worked with include Informatica, Flask, Git, REST APIs, Microsoft SQL Server, and Bootstrap. However, I really enjoy learning and trying new tools and languages. 

Thank you for visiting my personal website. For more information, you can check out my [resume][r]. If you would like to contact me, [email][email] me or reach out to me on [LinkedIn][li]. Also, you can check out some of the code I've written on my [Github][gh].
