My name is Michael Giannella, and I am a Junior Computer Engineering student at [Rutgers University][ru] in New Brunswick, NJ. On campus, I am involved in the [Institute of Electrical and Electronics Engineers (IEEE)][ieee] club as a [N2E][n2e] Python instructor, where I teach weekly classes to undergraduates looking to expand their skillset. I also play intramural basketball and flag football. Outside of school, I've worked at [Amazon][azn] and [Prudential Global Investment Management][pgim].

<!--This past summer, I worked at [Prudential Global Investment Management][pgim] in the Investments Technology department. I worked on a team that was redesigning monolithic applications and processes and converting them to a microservice architecture all connected through a central portal. As an Application and Systems Development intern, I worked on a web application for calculating dividend payout dates, I administered Windows servers, and I wrote scripts to automate processes on the servers, such as vital reporting and TFS release reporting.-->

This past summer, I worked at [Amazon][azn] with the Alexa Benchmarking Infrastructure team. My team was responsible for machine learning model release and certification within Alexa. As a SDE Intern, I worked on a project that centralized and automated the processes for regularly gathering business metrics. Through this project, I was able to engineer a pipeline that used AWS S3, Cloudwatch, Redshift, and Lambda to gather and store business metrics. For presenting the stored data, I created views in Tableau to provide a meaningful dashboard for business leaders to view. 

I'm interested in DevOps and software engineering in general. I enjoy working both on the product and the process, and working as efficiently as possible, leveraging any tools that may be useful. I have experience working with Python, Java, C, C#, SQL, and HTML/CSS. Additionally, some technologies I've worked with include AWS, Django, Spring, Git, REST APIs, and Serverless Architecture. However, I really enjoy learning and trying new tools and languages.
